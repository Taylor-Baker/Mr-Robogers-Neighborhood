## Description

_A funny little robot who always counts his own way. Enter a number and Mr. Roboger will count to that number. The only difference between him counting and you counting is that any number with a 1 in it, he will say "beep", any number with a 2 in it, he will say "boop", and any number with a 3 in it, Mr. Roboger will say "Won't you be my neighbor?"_
